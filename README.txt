This is a Pyhton interpretation of the Lox Interpreter from Crafting interpreters. 
Of course only the basic scanner part of this is functioning.

This guy made a Python version of the interpreter and I used his code as a refernece: 
Github site: https://github.com/largomst/LoxPy
Author: largomst

To run the test file, simply type into the terminal the following:
python Lox.py ltest.lox

The book didn't specify anything to make the output look nicer and I didn't see anything specific to that 
in the HW05 description so it just spits out some raw data but specifies when it finds a token.
